    do u really want to read a long ahh text...

- i first learned coding a mobile app on a low end phone using **Sketchware** *(removed from playstore)*.
- there are almost no tutorials on how to use it and the community is very small.
- i barely even understand java because there is no typing involved. its all drag-and-drop similar to scratch (mit).
- after a while i moved on to **AIDE** *(also removed from playstore)*.
- its a very steep learning curve and so frustrating to use.
- it took me about 3 years to fully grasp android java and develop apps more easily.
- eventually i was fortunate enough to have a laptop.
- but still, the experience i got from coding on a phone is unmatched.
- its very unheard of because all of the tools for coding are available on pc and very limited on mobile devices.
- but the difference is that its super convenient and more productive, imo.
- besides u can code anywhere and in any position u want not just sitting and staring on a computer screen.
- that is why i want to create an app that is easy to use and faster to develop on. at least in my opinion.

told u its long.
